Review of your awesome code!
======================

Review questions from learnhowtoprogram.com
Is the Github documentation - commits and README - thorough and descriptive?
Is the code easy to read (good indentation, spacing, naming)?
Were branching and looping used effectively?
Is the web page(s) styled using Bootstrap and CSS?
Is the site user-friendly?
Do you have any additional constructive criticism or positive feedback to share?

1. You forgot to put in a readme.md. I would suggest doing this as part of your initial project setup, in your first or second commit, and then updating it at the end of the project.

2. Indentation on html was close, but the head area was double indented. Spacing and indenting on the js file looks perfect. I would suggest placing comments in your code over different sections to make reading and review easier (and keep complicated code organized). A little white space would not hurt either.

3. Your for loop looks great. I think you could use the letters i, j, k, etc in place of index (a general standard) but everything is kosher. I think this is an older version than what I saw earlier, the error in your js is still there though. jQuery needs to point at the ID creamflav not the CLASS creamflav. I commented out yours and replaced with a working line.

4. I don't see any styling or use of bootstrap. But the point of this project was functionality, and the list is now populating (see above note and comments in main.js).

5. Its not user unfriendly.

6. On the right path. You clearly understanding grabbing elements with jQuery, traversing, and inserting elements.

## Great Job!
